ExpAn: Experiment Analysis
==========================

A/B tests, or randomized controlled experiments, have been widely
applied in different industries to optimize the business process and the
user experience. ExpAn, or Experiment Analysis, is a Python library
developed for the advanced statistical analysis of A/B tests.

The data structures and functions here are generic such that they can be
used by both data scientists optimizing a user interface and biologists
running wet-lab experiments. The library is also standalone and can be
imported and used from within other projects and from the command line.

Major statistical functionalities include:

- **feature check**
- **delta**
- **subgroup analysis**
- **trend**

Quick start
===========

Install
-------

To install simply run

::

    python2 setup.py install

And to test run:

::

    python2 setup.py test

Some mock-up data
-----------------

::

    from expan.experiment import Experiment
    from tests.test_data import generate_random_data

    exp = Experiment('B', *generate_random_data())
    exp.delta()
	

Further documentation
=====================

Additional documentation, which can be found in the ``doc`` folder,
contains: - detailed explanation of the data structure - an intro-level
presentation in the form of an iPython notebook - a script to convert
the iPython notebook to reveal.js slides and serve them on localhost

How to contribute
=================

Style guide
-----------

We follow `PEP8 standards <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`__
with the following exceptions:

- Use *tabs instead of spaces* - this allows all individuals to have visual depth of indentation they prefer, without changing the source code at all, and it is simply smaller

Branching / Release
-------------------

We currently use the gitflow workflow. Feature branches are created from
and merged back to the ``dev`` branch, and the ``master`` branch stores
snapshots/releases of the ``dev`` branch.

See also the much simpler github flow
`here <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__

Versioning
----------

**For the sake of reproducibility, always be sure to work with a release
when doing the analysis!**

We use semantic versioning (http://semver.org), and the current version of
ExpAn is: v0.1.6.

The version is maintained in ``setup.cfg``, and propagated from there to various files
by the ``bumpversion`` program. The most important propagation destination is
in ``version.py`` where it is held in the string ``__version__`` with
the form:

::

    '{major}.{minor}.{patch}'

The ``__version__`` string and a ``version()`` function is imported by
``core.__init__`` and so is accessible to imported functions in expan.

The ``version(format_str)`` function generates version strings of any
form. It can use git's commit count and revision number to generate a
long version string which may be useful for pip versioning? Examples:
NB: caution using this... it won't work if not in the original git
repository.

::

    >>> import core.binning
    >>> core.version()
    'v0.1.6'
    >>> core.version('{major}.{minor}..{commits}')
    '0.0..176'
    >>> core.version('{commit}')
    'a24730a42a4b5ae01bbdb05f6556dedd453c1767'

See: `StackExchange
151558 <http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/151558>`__

Bumping Version
---------------

Can use bumpversion to maintain the ``__version__`` in ``version.py``:

::

    $ bumpversion patch
    or
    $ bumpversion minor

This will update the version number, create a new tag in git, and commit
the changes with a standard commit message.

When you have done this, you must push the commit and new tag to the
repository with:

::

    $ git push --tags

TODO
----

-  parallelization, eg. for the bootstrapping code
-  Bayesian updating/early stopping
-  multiple comparison correction, definitely relevant for delta and
   SGA, have to think about how to correct for time dependency in the
   trend analysis
-  implement from\_json and to\_json methods in the Binning class, in
   order to convert the Python object to a json format for persisting in
   the Results metadata and reloading from a script
